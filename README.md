This is the code repository for my Turn-Based Battle game that I am developing (purely out of passion and love for turn-based games) using the Roblox game engine!

Initially, this started as a way for me to practice writing TypeScript code & learning React without actually having to write front-end code.
I also tried to be as professional as possible (with branching), keyword: tried.
That sounds weird, and it does, but it's just like I like making games and found out this magical thing called Roblox-Typescript!


Okay, now as for a reflection of what I've learned, so far:
- Also, I just found TypeScript to be really, really fascinating! The art of writing custom types and the different ways to achieve that, I find it so cool. (and I also found it fun to throw prompts at generative AI to have it generate types for me ðŸ˜„)
- React concepts was also really cool. (it also added a lot to my daily word-bank as now I throw around words and phrases like "pure" "impure" and "side-effect" all the time)


The yap ends here, to whoever may be here IDK how you found your way there but feel free to explore my turn-based battle code:
- I began envisioning this system as early as ~2021, and it's designed to eventually have easy support/scalability on whatever mechanics I plan to add. Revival, stacking marks like crazy, etc.
- There were numerous iterations of this written "back-in-the-days" using Lua, this is apparently... the 9th edition.
- The turn-based system originally was intended to be four abilities and each character would have their own kit, but now it's a turn-based card system.
- This whole "envisioning this system as early as ~2021" originally started because I thought: "If I have a game of my own I could do whatever I want, including giving myself unlimited currency!"


I'll revise this README later, and perhaps add more lore and backstory.
